      <h2>What is The difference Between map, find, filter, forEach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Map: Map Returns An Array With The Same Length. That Means, if we want to get each element of an array, we can use Map & it's return the all value with new array </li>
        <li>Find: it checks every element of an array, returns all value which is match its condition, & return the value with an new array</li>
        <li>Filter:We use it on an array, & try check the all elements of an array, but if any value will match with its condition, immidiately it stops. & return the matching value.  </li>
        <li>forEach: it is used to execute the same code on every element in an array & it don't return any value</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is The Difference between localStorage, SessionStorage  & Cookies. 
        <ul>
            <li>LocalStorage: it can store large number of data. & The most advantage of local storage is, data is not delete when we close the browser. it is very useful for a user, because, he can access the data when he open the browser later</li>
            <li>SessionStorage: it is almost similiar with localstorage, but the difference is, we can store the data in current session, if we close the browser, we can not access the data</li>
            <li>Cookies: It Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests.Cookies are primarily for server-side reading.</li>
        </ul>
